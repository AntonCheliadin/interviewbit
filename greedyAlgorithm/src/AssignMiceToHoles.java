public class AssignMiceToHoles {
    /*
    There are N Mice and N holes are placed in a straight line.
    Each hole can accomodate only 1 mouse.
    A mouse can stay at his position, move one step right from x to x + 1, or move one step left from x to x âˆ’ 1. Any of these moves consumes 1 minute.
    Assign mice to holes so that the time when the last mouse gets inside a hole is minimized.

    Example:
    positions of mice are:
    4 -4 2
    positions of holes are:
    4 0 5

    Assign mouse at position x=4 to hole at position x=4 : Time taken is 0 minutes
    Assign mouse at position x=-4 to hole at position x=0 : Time taken is 4 minutes
    Assign mouse at position x=2 to hole at position x=5 : Time taken is 3 minutes
    After 4 minutes all of the mice are in the holes.

    Since, there is no combination possible where the last mouse's time is less than 4,
    answer = 4.
    Input:
    A :  list of positions of mice
    B :  list of positions of holes
    Output:
    single integer value
